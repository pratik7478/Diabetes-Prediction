# Diabetes-Prediction
  Data visualization and exploratory data analysis are performed on Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The aim is to construct a classifier to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on a set of diagnostics.  After cleaning the data, importance of features are analyzed using different methods. An MLP classifier is trained with cross validation. Optimal parameters are found using grid search. Instead of using scikit-learn, we will write our own grid search function due to some issues explained below. Then we will draw roc curve of the classifier and find the optimal operating point.
